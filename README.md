ECE 382 Lab 2

#Prelab

The prelab for this lab consisted of setting up a flowchart to describe how the code will work to decrypt the encrypted message.  The following flowchart depicts the path that my code will take.

#Required Functionality

In order to achieve required functionality, the following encrypted message had to be decrypted.   

```
0xef,0xc3,0xc2,0xcb,0xde,0xcd,0xd8,0xd9,0xc0,0xcd,0xd8,0xc5,0xc3,0xc2,0xdf,0x8d,0x8c,0x8c,0xf5,0xc3,0xd9,0x8c,0xc8,0xc9,0xcf,0xde,0xd5,0xdc,0xd8,0xc9,0xc8,0x8c,0xd8,0xc4,0xc9,0x8c,0xe9,0xef,0xe9,0x9f,0x94,0x9e,0x8c,0xc4,0xc5,0xc8,0xc8,0xc9,0xc2,0x8c,0xc1,0xc9,0xdf,0xdf,0xcd,0xcb,0xc9,0x8c,0xcd,0xc2,0xc8,0x8c,0xcd,0xcf,0xc4,0xc5,0xc9,0xda,0xc9,0xc8,0x8c,0xde,0xc9,0xdd,0xd9,0xc5,0xde,0xc9,0xc8,0x8c,0xca,0xd9,0xc2,0xcf,0xd8,0xc5,0xc3,0xc2,0xcd,0xc0,0xc5,0xd8,0xd5,0x8f
```
The key is `0xac`


#B Functionality

In order to achieve B functionality, an arbitrarily long key is used to decrypt the message.  The message to be decrypted is as follows.

```
0xf8,0xb7,0x46,0x8c,0xb2,0x46,0xdf,0xac,0x42,0xcb,0xba,0x03,0xc7,0xba,0x5a,0x8c,0xb3,0x46,0xc2,0xb8,0x57,0xc4,0xff,0x4a,0xdf,0xff,0x12,0x9a,0xff,0x41,0xc5,0xab,0x50,0x82,0xff,0x03,0xe5,0xab,0x03,0xc3,0xb1,0x4f,0xd5,0xff,0x40,0xc3,0xb1,0x57,0xcd,0xb6,0x4d,0xdf,0xff,0x4f,0xc9,0xab,0x57,0xc9,0xad,0x50,0x80,0xff,0x53,0xc9,0xad,0x4a,0xc3,0xbb,0x50,0x80,0xff,0x42,0xc2,0xbb,0x03,0xdf,0xaf,0x42,0xcf,0xba,0x50,0x8f
```
The key is `0xacdf23`
